  abstract = {This study investigates the design and analysis of a stepped plate parametric array loudspeaker (SPPAL) as an alternative to conventional array-based parametric loudspeakers. The SPPAL utilizes a single Langevin-type ultrasonic transducer coupled with a flexural stepped plate to generate narrow-beam audible sound via nonlinear acoustic interaction. To evaluate and optimize the performance of the SPPAL, an integrated modeling framework is developed, consisting of an approximate analytical three-dimensional model for transducer dynamics, an equivalence ratio formulation to relate stepped plate and rigid piston behavior, and a spherical wave expansion method for nonlinear sound field simulation. The dual-resonance behavior of the transducer is optimized through multi-objective analysis to enhance low-frequency audio performance. Experimental validation includes frequency response and modal analysis of the transducer, as well as sound field measurements. The analytical methods are further verified through comparison with experimental data. Furthermore, combination resonance---an unintended structural excitation resulting from intermodulation---is identified as an inherent phenomenon in SPPAL operation. The findings offer practical guidance for the development of efficient, compact, and manufacturable parametric array loudspeakers employing plate-based flexural vibration.},

  abstract = {The association of color and sound helps human cognition through a synergetic effect like intersensory facilitation. Although soft human-machine interfaces (HMIs) providing unisensory expression have been widely developed, achieving synchronized optic and acoustic expression in one device system has been relatively less explored. It is because their operating principles are different in terms of materials, and implementation has mainly been attempted through structural approaches. Here, a deformable sound display is developed that generates multiple colored lights with large sound at low input voltage. The device is based on alternating-current electroluminescence (ACEL) covered with perovskite composite films. A sound wave is created by a polymer matrix of the ACEL, while simultaneously, various colors are produced by the perovskite films and the blue electroluminescence (EL) emitted from the phosphors in the ACEL. By patterning different colored perovskite films onto the ACELs, associating the color and the sound is successfully demonstrated by a piano keyboard and a wearable interactive device.},

  abstract = {Wearable auditory sensors are critical in user-friendly sound-recognition systems for smart human--machine interaction and the Internet of Things. However, previously reported wearable sensors have limited sound-sensing quality as a consequence of a poor frequency response and a narrow acoustic-pressure range. Here, a skin-attachable acoustic sensor is presented that has higher sensing accuracy in wider auditory field than human ears, with flat frequency response (15--10 000 Hz) and a good range of linearity (29--134 dBSPL) as well as high conformality to flexible surfaces and human skin. This high sound-sensing quality is achieved by exploiting the low residual stress and high processability of polymer materials in a diaphragm structure designed using acousto-mechano-electric modeling. Thus, this acoustic sensor shows high acoustic fidelity by sensing human-audible sounds, even loud sounds and low-frequency sounds that human ears cannot detect without distorting them. The polymer-based ultrasmall ({$<$}9 mm2) and thin sensor maintains sound-detection quality on flexible substrates and in a wide temperature range (25 to 90 {$^\circ$}C). The acoustic sensor shows a significant potential of auditory electronic skin, by recognizing voice successfully when the sensor attached on human skin is connected to a commercial mobile device running the latest artificial intelligence assistant.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
