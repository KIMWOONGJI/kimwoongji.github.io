  abstract = {Growing interest has been devoted to developing soft sensors capable of detecting mechano-acoustic signals, as many vital physiological signals manifest as broadband cues beyond quasi-static regimes. Electrospun nanomeshes (NMs) have emerged as promising candidates due to their lightweight structure, superior flexibility, and efficient mechanoelectrical conversion. However, current NM-based sensors relying on piezoelectric or triboelectric mechanisms suffer from non-flat frequency responses, nonlinear sensitivities, and large form factors. Here, a soft polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) NM-based capacitive sensor is presented that overcomes these limitations. Distinct from conventional NM designs, the PVDF NM functions as the diaphragm in a capacitive sensor, self-generating the bias voltage required for its operation. This capacitive architecture enables substantial miniaturization, while the porous NM structure improves air permeability and reduces air damping. The resulting sensor delivers a flat frequency response (80--3000 Hz), high linear sensitivity (313 mV g-1), and an ultracompact size (0.25 cm2), offering exceptional performance across key metrics. Its soft, skin-conformal design allows seamless adhesion to the neck for accurate detection of broadband physiological signals---including voice and coughs---positioning it as a promising platform for voice-driven IoT, human--machine interfaces, and mobile healthcare.},

  abstract = {High-fidelity capture of physiological signals across a broad frequency spectrum requires soft vibration sensors with exceptional performance. However, existing devices fail to achieve uniformly high sensitivity across the full spectrum while maintaining reliable, low-power operation. Here we report a piezoelectric-powered capacitive vibration sensor that overcomes these limitations. In this design, a piezoelectric diaphragm serves as a non-contact power source, generating a stable bias field and actively modulating the signal to enable self-powered operation. To further enhance performance, we implement a device architecture featuring in-plane air ventilation and maximized sensor array density. The resulting sensors exhibit a linear sensitivity of 626\,mV\,g-1, a flat frequency response from 80 to 5,000\,Hz, an ultralow detection limit of 0.01\,g and a signal-to-noise ratio of 80\,dB, representing substantial improvements over conventional devices. We demonstrate that the hyperpacked, piezoelectric-powered sensor array enables high-fidelity detection of music, voice and respiratory signals by capturing subtle mechanical vibrations.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the design and analysis of a stepped plate parametric array loudspeaker (SPPAL) as an alternative to conventional array-based parametric loudspeakers. The SPPAL utilizes a single Langevin-type ultrasonic transducer coupled with a flexural stepped plate to generate narrow-beam audible sound via nonlinear acoustic interaction. To evaluate and optimize the performance of the SPPAL, an integrated modeling framework is developed, consisting of an approximate analytical three-dimensional model for transducer dynamics, an equivalence ratio formulation to relate stepped plate and rigid piston behavior, and a spherical wave expansion method for nonlinear sound field simulation. The dual-resonance behavior of the transducer is optimized through multi-objective analysis to enhance low-frequency audio performance. Experimental validation includes frequency response and modal analysis of the transducer, as well as sound field measurements. The analytical methods are further verified through comparison with experimental data. Furthermore, combination resonance---an unintended structural excitation resulting from intermodulation---is identified as an inherent phenomenon in SPPAL operation. The findings offer practical guidance for the development of efficient, compact, and manufacturable parametric array loudspeakers employing plate-based flexural vibration.},

  abstract = {The association of color and sound helps human cognition through a synergetic effect like intersensory facilitation. Although soft human-machine interfaces (HMIs) providing unisensory expression have been widely developed, achieving synchronized optic and acoustic expression in one device system has been relatively less explored. It is because their operating principles are different in terms of materials, and implementation has mainly been attempted through structural approaches. Here, a deformable sound display is developed that generates multiple colored lights with large sound at low input voltage. The device is based on alternating-current electroluminescence (ACEL) covered with perovskite composite films. A sound wave is created by a polymer matrix of the ACEL, while simultaneously, various colors are produced by the perovskite films and the blue electroluminescence (EL) emitted from the phosphors in the ACEL. By patterning different colored perovskite films onto the ACELs, associating the color and the sound is successfully demonstrated by a piano keyboard and a wearable interactive device.},

  abstract = {Wearable auditory sensors are critical in user-friendly sound-recognition systems for smart human--machine interaction and the Internet of Things. However, previously reported wearable sensors have limited sound-sensing quality as a consequence of a poor frequency response and a narrow acoustic-pressure range. Here, a skin-attachable acoustic sensor is presented that has higher sensing accuracy in wider auditory field than human ears, with flat frequency response (15--10 000 Hz) and a good range of linearity (29--134 dBSPL) as well as high conformality to flexible surfaces and human skin. This high sound-sensing quality is achieved by exploiting the low residual stress and high processability of polymer materials in a diaphragm structure designed using acousto-mechano-electric modeling. Thus, this acoustic sensor shows high acoustic fidelity by sensing human-audible sounds, even loud sounds and low-frequency sounds that human ears cannot detect without distorting them. The polymer-based ultrasmall ({$<$}9 mm2) and thin sensor maintains sound-detection quality on flexible substrates and in a wide temperature range (25 to 90 {$^\circ$}C). The acoustic sensor shows a significant potential of auditory electronic skin, by recognizing voice successfully when the sensor attached on human skin is connected to a commercial mobile device running the latest artificial intelligence assistant.},
